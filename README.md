# Udacity's FEND Cat Clicker Project

In the Frontend Web Development Nanodegree Programm at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) part 4 of the syllabus is all about building front-end applications on a professional level so it introduces the student to Ajax, Angular, Ember and Service Workers. To get familiar with writing well structured code and adapting to ever changing expactions this course unit starts of with the requirement to build an simple cat clicker. Throughout the course the expactions in regard to the cat clicker expand.

## Stage #01

**Requirements**

> "The application should display a picture of a cat and a number of clicks. The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like. The number of clicks should increment when the cat picture is clicked."

**Reflection**

First I thought, that it would be rather simple and straightforward to build this. But my event listener function didn't worked at first and it quickly felt like I had everything forgotten.

I am really thankfull for this project and the learning opportunity to start from scratch.

## Stage #02

**Requirements**

> "The application should display two cats. Each cat includes the cat's name, a picture of the cat [and] text showing the number of clicks. The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked."

To me it is not entirely clear wether the two click counter should be independent from each other, but I assume it for now.
